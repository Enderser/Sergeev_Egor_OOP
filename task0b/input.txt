Every day we hear our planet is in danger. A lot of people are trying to do something to protect the environment, but the situation is getting worse every moment. Take the water for example. It is really important for everything alive on the Earth. 
But there is little water that is drinkable and good to use for cooking. A lot of rivers and lakes are so polluted that even fish cannot live there. Beaches that were clean fifty years ago are very dirty now, so people can’t have their holidays where they liked to stay. Lake Baikal which was famous for its clean waters and natural beauty is in great danger because of the factories near it. In some places the water in the lake is so dirty that it kills everything in and around. 
If the pollution is not stopped, the lake will be lost.
